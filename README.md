# PLEASE NOTE
  This is still under construction. It's not even alpha. I will have a view-only Trello available soon so you all can see into my development process.

## What do I want with this?
  To create a powerful Open-Source project focused on solving mathematical problems using the most wide-spread langague of the century: :sparkles:JavaScript:sparkles:
  The OCR module is using the [Tesseract OCR](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) under the curtains for optical recognition of equations (will implement Tesseract Training as well. Sometime).

  I intend to create a large enough data-set to train a specific neural-network for solving any math problem. Much like Wolfram, but free as a bird :bird:.
